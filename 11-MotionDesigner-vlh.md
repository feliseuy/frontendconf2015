cubic bezier.
changes the way things feel.  
not everything stops at once
everything looks more energetic and happier

can add variables to make things easier

supplemental action recinforces and adds dimension
into modal
e.g. two smaller animations for text. 

looks more human and excited. 
different times, more energy.  
just by changing, easing, text moving at different rate.

see things slower first to see if hit mark, then speed it up after. 

research : between 0.1 to 1s to complete a UI animation
but in RL, closer to 0.2 to 0.5s

ease-outs feel more "responsive" than ease ins
start fast and ends slow

if easing is complex, change the time to longer and vice versa
