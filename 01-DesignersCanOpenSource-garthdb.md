A humble manifesto - his personal goals 
find opps to design in the open
share designs both good and bad - design are hard work
find time for meaningul projects
openly participate in design discussion
work with other designers by choice' 

how -
1share your process - start a design journal.  when done if can't share the processs the whole time..  wait til it's launched then ask if youcan publish it.
2. share your source files - dropbox public folder
3. use code as a design tool
4. collaborate - posterrrs

6.  contribute  - github
