#Designing Together Apart
##Jared Ponchot


find ways to become really fascinated with people
you'll generate so amny more insights to make beter decisions.  more energy for creative work. 

harry harlow - primate lab
whether monkeys would have interest
curiosity  got better of them. 
NO reward. most interesting thing

then he added a reward...

monkey who solve problem get raisins..
found the opposite ,the ones who got rewards got worse. 
less interested and weren't participate

@ princeton
candle problem
find a way to make candle mounted on wall without letting anything drip on the table
in 60s, does experiment with cash reward to half group
performance considerably worse

read - relationship between reward and creative work - detrimental

children - gave book and make up story from pictures
some no reward
others give reward to play with polaroid camera
found the same thing...  kids were so much more creative without a reward.

Creatives are pro-choice
50 college students personality test
pretend video stopped working.
group1 - no choice, no reward - 
2 - no choice, reward
3 - choice, no reward
4 - choice, reward
made collages and then were judged.
reward led to most creative work and least creative.
choice group - better
no choice, reward - worst. --> this is work everyday

how powerful for people to own ideas and insights

encourage Flat communicate - team members part of how and work you're going to take on
in colocated env. very easy to take for granted.  you assume people's ideas will come up.  
Be intentional about getting people's idea. 
he is most proud of his teams ideas

ownership and intrinsic motivation are huge. 

one technight  5:15
send out email once a week.  spend no more than 15 minutes to write, and 5 to read
ask good questions - some default. things you're trying to figure out
so powerful
what's gone well lately?
what's been challenging?
what are u learning?
what are you excited about
what's 1 way i could make your life better. 

Energy & spaces
care about space. hipster, exposed brick, etc.. is what typically we think
opposite is true.
individual ownership of the kind of space ppl have
You-shaped space.
gives freedome for them to change their space/
break up your work area.
such a help to change the atmospher - 
possible pitfall of distributed team... 
if distributed team - equip, encourage and nourture care about space
maintain a dialog...  teling people where you're working
he works way better in coffee shop or deck for any writing
energy level stays way high just because of that change.
1-3 hours to make their workspace better. only requirement - post to team what you've done. 
team is driving each other to care about space

Collab myth
collab is an awesome tool but often not the best tool.  when to use and how

**Quiet - Susan gain?.  
tested efficacy of group brainstorming
individuals produce way more ideas. plus higher quality and more of them when not working together... 

^how impoartnat focus is to quality work

helpful collab ways - 
rather than group whiteboard.  get stack of paper and pencil
here's the problem set, give 20 min. come back with at least 1, but as many as 20 solid ideas.
really quick way of getting to consensus around ideas.
collab but also letting people work individually

tools
hangouts
ipvocams
pencil and paper

cog psychology
people asked to doole while reading names
30% more was rememberd when doodling

Tom woojack?   Draw how to make toast.  
**do this as a group activity
groups with no verbal comm 
way better ideas and less tim

Temptation to replace visual with verbal
words are an abstraction of reality. brains do a lot of work to maintiain things
find ways to keep things real and visual

"don't half ass two things, whole as one things"

focus is one of the moist powerful tools

lots you can say about critiques...
weekly show and tell..  ppl can get critique
invision app has liveshare
biggest key.  exist to produce insights. asking good questions and helping ppl see things that they weren't seeing before. person doing work gets own clear new vision. 
build trust.  as a rule, when ppl know their loved, there's trust
practice gratitude (5:15), appreciation, etc. 

Lovers - 
Design is for Lovers - see things the way others so  you can solve their problems and make their lives better.  b/c their problems are your problems, not b/c it's work.  one of the best ways to have a great designer look at the way of having a great marriage.
empathy, understanding,
