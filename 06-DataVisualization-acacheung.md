HTML CSS side of client projects

encoding - design and dev
users - decoding

start with a question...  then look into what kind of graph would be effective.

tools:
Highcharts
RAFAEL - svg based graphics

Integrity
Don't unintentionally skew results to what you want users to see

Takeaway - 
users need to do as little work as possible to get information

accessibility is baked in when you have semantic html
table is accessible by screen reader.
inspect should show clean semantic html **
all infor should be written out so it's not lost without a visual

Keyboard shortcuts for accessibility
inaccessible if no keyboard support
Github has a lot of keyboard shortcuts

that's why text editors like vim are popuplar

good urls are good for sharing and history

44px x 44px - target size for mobile
broke things into media queries..., but..
use touch instead of hover for mobile
sometimes touch can happen on bigger screen
